# Python Beginner Drill Camp (4 Weeks)

A hands-on beginner Python course built around **repeating drills** and **small, daily labs**.

## How to use this repo
1. Install Python 3.11+ (or use your existing install).
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Each day:
   - Do the drills in `drills/` (timed).
   - Complete the lab in `labs/`.
   - Do the 10-minute **speed run**: rewrite your solution from memory.
   - Log your work in `progress/`.

## Run a file
From the repo root:
```bash
python week1/day1/drills/01_print_and_fstrings.py
```

## Course rules (the secret sauce)
- **Repetition beats novelty.** You’ll write the same pattern 10–20 times with small changes.
- Always test **edge cases**: empty input, 0, negative, weird strings.
- At the end of each week, rebuild one lab **from memory** in 15 minutes.

## Weekly themes
- Week 1: I/O, variables, types, math
- Week 2: Conditionals + input validation
- Week 3: Loops + lists
- Week 4: Functions + basic files
